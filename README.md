# angularStories

AngularStories is my first Angular project. It is a responsive retail shop. The shop was designed to be able to read an API of clothes, interpret the data, and then satisfy the following user stories:


> * [x] = Done

* [x] As a user I can add a product to my shopping list
* [x] As a user I can remove a product from my shopping cart
* [x] As a user I can view the total price for my products in my shopping cart
* [x] As a user I can apply a voucher to my shopping cart
* [x] As a user I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart with discounts applied
* [x] As a user I am alerted when I apply an invalid voucher to my shopping cart
